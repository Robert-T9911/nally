#The progress finishing vttest

= Introduction =

VTTEST is a very useful application to demonstrate features of VT100 and related terminals. It can also be used to test the compatibility of terminal emulator.

= Implementations =

 # Implemented response upon terminal type query, however Nally only replies it's a VT102.
 # Properly ignoring "Selects G0 character" control command: http://lh3.ggpht.com/_83P-OanxqzA/STbgAI6cVWI/AAAAAAAAARQ/HYs82Rfc_Ak/s640/Picture%201.png
 # Implemented `^[[K` to ease characters from cursor to the end of line.
 # Implemented `^[#8` to fill the whole screen with E for alignment test.
 # Cusor Movement Test 1: (backspace behavior) <img src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3292/3145320715_b4f1b41319_o.png width=640 />
 # Properly ignoring 132 column mode: `^[[?3h` and `^[[?3l`
 # Cusor Movement Test 3: (autowrap, scroll within a range of row) <img src=http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3088/3146153232_162a358b25_o.png width=640 />
